# U
### Unicode character copier

(Windows specific)
Places a text character in the clipboard so you can paste it wherever you need. Overwrites the clipboard.

To use: `u [code point]`

The code point is given as a hex number, i.e. 263A - 
Do not include the U+ prefix, or any programming prefixes such as 0x or $, just the hex digits.

The text is copied as a UTF-16 wide character type, and should
work with higher code points above the 16-bit range. 

That's about it, it's a very simple program. Hope it helps.
